# Python CSV Processing Assignments

## PyBank

1. Assignment asks us to determine some values, such as the number of months in the CSV file, the greatest increase, the greatest decrease and the total overall change.

2. We simply open the CSV file and iterate through the rows, updating the values as we parse the CSV.

## PyPoll

1. Assignment is more complex than the bank equivalent, requiring us to use a hashmap to store the voter names along with the corresponding number of votes.

2. Again, we parse the CSV and update the number of votes a given candidate has received, then compute the relative percentage.

3. Finally, we compare the number of votes received to determine a winner.

## Source Code
